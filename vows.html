      <h3>Ryan's Vows</h3>
      <p>
Anna, 
When we first met, we were basically still kids. Not even out of college, the fact of the matter is that I hadn’t yet figured out what was truly important or the values that I intended to live by. I think back to the road trip that we took before moving in together. Driving around the country, sleeping in the back of the truck, and spending every hour of the day together for the first time. 
It was during that trip I started to realize how a life with you could be so much more meaningful and worthwhile than a life without. I began to see that what was important to me was being a good partner. That your happiness and the experiences we could have together meant far more than anything I could do on my own. We’ve both grown so much since then. I can say with confidence that I am a better man today because of you.
I have no doubts that you are the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. I know this because the life we’ve already built together is richer and more wonderful than I ever could have hoped for. I’m immensely proud of what we have done so far, and I suspect the best things are still ahead of us.
Whenever we talk about our future, we’re almost always on the same page. I love that we have the same ideas about what matters in life and what does not. I love that you don’t allow me to take things too seriously. You have always valued the quality of our time and our relationships over anything material. You are caring and compassionate towards others in ways that I am not. Like how your co-workers always confide in you and tell you their traumas, even when you don’t really want to know. 
We’ve experienced a lot together already. We’ve lived in a tiny apartment, bought a house and fixed it up, and of course care for two great dogs. In all these milestones, we rarely knew what we were doing. We had to figure out what to do for the first time, and we didn’t always succeed. Sometimes overcoming these obstacles was very challenging. But what was always a constant was that we were in it together. That we were on the same side, no matter who was dealing with what.
•	I promise to always be on your side. To face challenges together, regardless of the situation or cause. 
•	I promise to appreciate the great things we already have. I will try not to take the good times for granted and cherish our life together.
•	I promise to care for you in the difficult times. To do everything I can to support you when life is at its most challenging.
•	Above all, I promise to always care for our relationship. To talk things out even when I don’t feel like talking. To have hard conversations when a hard conversation needs to be had. And to address any issues that we may face directly, rather than ignore or avoid them. 
Anna, I love you. Through care, compassion, and continual effort; we’ve built a phenomenal life. I’m thrilled to see what we will continue to build.
